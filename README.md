# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales transaction data to uncover insights into sales performance across regions, cities, product categories, and customer segments. The objective is to identify revenue drivers, profitability gaps, underperforming regions, and actionable strategies to improve business performance.
The analysis uses Excel, Python, and data visualization techniques to clean, explore, and interpret the data, making it suitable for business decision-making and stakeholder reporting.
## Objectives
- Identify top-performing and underperforming product categories
- Analyze the impact of discounts on profit
- Evaluate regional and city-level sales performance
- Detect loss-making products

## Tools & Technologies
